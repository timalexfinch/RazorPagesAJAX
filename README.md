# RazorPagesAJAX
Core 2.2<br />
 An application to show how to use jQuery and AJAX to call server-side code, using Razor Pages 2.2
<br />
On the home page, there are two GET examples. You can:
<br />
  &bull; call our own <strong>GetTime</strong> service <br />
  &bull; call a <strong>Get Random User</strong> service from the web <br />
Then there's a couple of AJAX POST examples at the bottom of the home page.<br />
If you click the PartialDemo link there's an eg of a partial page (no AJAX)
<br />
Finally, if you click the Products link, eventually, I'll write a data-driven Razor Page with AJAX.<br />
Currently, it's just a data-driven page, with paging and sorting, but no AJAX<br />
It has no partial page either. <br />
